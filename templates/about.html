    <p class="content"> I am a first year computer science M.S. student at Georgia Tech, advised by <a href="https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~parikh/">Prof. Devi Parikh</a>. The problems that I work on lie at the intersection of Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. Specifically, I am interested in developing AI models that can <!--</p>-->

    understand human preferences and biases, utilize this information for understanding human notions of creativity, and use this learnt knowledge to eventually generate new art in the current paradigm of acceptable art, or to create new forms of art altogether. I am also interested in training models to learn about visual and language-based incongruities in nature, and leverage this information to induce creativity.

    <!--<p class="content"> I am also interested in Computer Systems and Network Security. I spent Summer 2017 working with <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/arvinde/">Dr. Arvind Easwaran</a> on analyzing existing cross-layer modeling frameworks for Cyber Physical Systems at the Hardware and Embedded Systems Lab (HESL), NTU Singapore. Through this internship, I got to learn about relevant security considerations for a system, limitations in current state-of-the-art modeling frameworks, some specific vulnerabilities in Windows systems, and how to represent all this as a model at different layers of abstraction.</p>-->

    <p class="content">In my free time, I play the Harmonium instrument. I am very passionate about music. I love to learn about different music styles and their histories. I am also a trained Bharatnatyam dancer.</p>
