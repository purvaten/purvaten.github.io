Inferences made are based on my personal experiences and the admits and rejects that I got. FYI, I will be joining Georgia Tech for Masters in Computer Science in Fall 2018.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My admits (all MS CS) : GaTech, UPenn, UC San Diego, UCLA, USC&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My rejects (all MS CS) : Stanford, UT Austin, UMD College Park, UIUC, UNC Chapel Hill&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;preparation&quot;&gt;Preparation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most students realize in the middle of their third year that they want to apply for MS, and immediately start fussing over how to build a good CV for it. It is important to understand that you cannot build a CV overnight. But consistent grades in relevant subjects, completed, working projects (with the sourcecode available on GitHub along with a well-written README) and extra projects (other than course projects or in the form of internships) are good ways to show that you have utilized the 4 years of your undergraduate life well. Of course, it is important that this information be compiled coherently in a CV. Since there is no standard format format for CVs, it is important that you take your time finding (or building a good template) in LaTeX. Your CV is your technical selling point so make sure that it is well-written. Sell yourself well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;actually-writing-your-cv&quot;&gt;Actually writing your CV&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DO not lie. Overly impressive achievements arouse suspicion, and if not backed up with grades, LoRs or credible sources, they will only act as a deterrent. Be honest. Refrain from mentioning papers published in random (possibly blacklisted) conferences. Rather, refrain from publishing in such conferences or journals altogether. Mentions of such papers will only act negatively on your application so only mention them if they have been published in reputed conferences. Don’t worry if your CV doesn’t have a huge list of awards or isn’t more than 1-2 pages. Rather, shorter but well-written CVs are appreciated better. Jean Yang’s CV is a good reference for this. You can also choose to be creative and go for something cool like Joseph Redmon’s resume. This might be a little risky and you should be super confident of your skills to make something like this. Of course on the bright side, it shows creativity and actually looks really cool!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important thing to keep in mind is not to mention too many achievements of your school days in your CV. Unless they are exceptional achievements like national/international level scholarships, Olympiad wins or something of that calibre, they will not be very useful in proving how good a student you have been in the last 4+ years. For example, quiz winner in an inter-school event or house captain are not really worth mentioning, especially the latter since you are applying for graduate studies in a technical field, not a management course. Of course it doesn’t hurt to be an all-rounder, but be sure to choose the content in your CV carefully as it will reflect what you consider to be your biggest achievements. If house captain was considered big enough to make it to your CV, it might reflect negatively on your application.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Purva Tendulkar</name><email>purva.tendulkar@gmail.com</email></author><category term="blogs" /><summary type="html">DISCLAIMER - These are purely my opinions and what helped me in my applications.
